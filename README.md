What is C++?

C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as an extension of the C programming language. It combines procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming features, making it one of the most powerful and widely used programming languages.

Key Features of C++:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Supports concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
High Performance: Provides low-level memory manipulation, making it suitable for system programming and real-time applications.
Standard Template Library (STL): Includes pre-built libraries for data structures, algorithms, and iterators.
Portability: Can be compiled and run on multiple platforms with minimal modification.
Memory Management: Allows manual memory allocation and deallocation using new and delete.
Multi-Paradigm Support: Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming styles.

Uses of C++:

Game Development: Used in engines like Unreal Engine.
System Programming: Used for developing operating systems, databases, and embedded systems.
High-Performance Computing: Utilized in scientific computing and simulations.
Finance & Banking: Used in high-frequency trading applications.
Web Browsers & Software Development: Many browsers (like Chrome, Firefox) use C++ for performance-critical components.

Basic C++ Program:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

This program prints "Hello, C++!" to the console.
